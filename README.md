# Plagiarism Checker for Problem Sets: App_Name

## Overview
PW3 is a sophisticated plagiarism checker designed to scrutinize problem sets on platforms such as CodeForces and CodeChef. By cross-referencing new problem sets against existing ones, it assists contest managers in determining the originality of the content. Furthermore, the application can be extended to verify the originality of patent applications or academic research papers.

## Key Features

+ Deep Content Analysis: Scrutinizes the content deeply, looking at the structure, wording, and intent of the problem sets to identify similarities.
+ Extensible Framework: While the initial version focuses on problem sets, PW3 can be expanded to check the originality of patent applications and academic papers.
+ Open Source Integration: Leverages the power of the open-source "LLM App" by Pathway to enhance its checking capabilities.
+ Repository Hosting: The application will be hosted as an open-source project on GitHub, allowing the community to contribute and enhance its features.

## Example Outputs
+ Problem Set Verification:
Input: New problem set from a contest.
Output: A report highlighting any similarities with existing problem sets, along with links and similarity scores.
+ Patent Verification:
Input: New patent application.
Output: A report indicating any existing patents with similar concepts or methodologies.
+ Academic Paper Verification:
Input: New research paper.
Output: A report indicating any existing research papers with similar findings, methodology, or content.
+ Technical Specifications
Languages: Python (for backend logic and algorithm), JavaScript (for frontend and user interface).

## Libraries & Frameworks:

1. For Plagiarism Checking: PyTorch (for deep learning models), Scikit-learn (for machine learning).
2. For Web Application: Flask (for backend), React (for frontend).
3. For Integration with LLM App: Pathway's official API.
4. Database: PostgreSQL (for storing problem sets, research papers, and other reference documents).

<code> Hosting: GitHub for source code, Heroku or AWS for hosting the web application. </code>

## Development Roadmap

Phase 1: Develop the core plagiarism checking algorithm focusing on problem sets. Test it on sample data from CodeForces and CodeChef.
Phase 2: Integrate the LLM App by Pathway to enhance the checker's capabilities.
Phase 3: Extend the framework to support patent and academic paper verification.
Phase 4: Develop the web application and user interface. Host the application on the chosen platform.
Phase 5: Open-source the project on GitHub and invite the community for contributions.

# Conclusion
App_Name aims to revolutionize the way contest managers, patent examiners, and academic researchers verify the originality of content. By harnessing advanced algorithms and community contributions, it seeks to provide an accurate, efficient, and extensible solution for plagiarism detection.
